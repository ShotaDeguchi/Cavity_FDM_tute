# Cavity_FDM_tute

This repository provides a tutorial on the Finite Difference Method (FDM) for simulating advection, diffusion, advection-diffusion, and incompressible Navier-Stokes equations.

Further extensions and numerical results can be found in [Cavity_FDM_NumPy2](https://github.com/ShotaDeguchi/Cavity_FDM_NumPy2).
